# Programming-fundementals

Two applications are created for this project:
- One for analysing `Javadoc` comments in a `Java` file.
- The other for analysing `C` files and outputting a `identifiers.txt`, which includes a symbol table with the included variable names, types, functions, arrays, for/while loops, and if statements in the code. Also listing their declaration and number of uses.
